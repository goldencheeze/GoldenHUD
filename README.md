# GoldenHUD
**My custom HUD for TF2. Blends some elements from ToonHUD and m0rehud**
## Installation
Drop .zip into Team Fortress 2/tf/custom directory. If you don't know how to get there, the fastest way is to open up Steam, right click TF2 in the library, go to properties, local files, and hit browse. Unzipping is optional.
